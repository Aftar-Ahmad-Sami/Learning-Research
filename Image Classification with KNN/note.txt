KNN is never used in Image Classification because

1. It is slow. Complexity of Training is O(1) and prediction is O(n)
2. Distance metrics is not informative especially L2 (Euclidean) distance for similar distorted images as it may be same for all cases.
3. Curse of Dimensionality because for every k-nearest neighbour classifier of n dimensions we would need exponention of 4^n space of densely populated points in training example
